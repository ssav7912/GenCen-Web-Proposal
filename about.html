   <h2>Our History</h2>
   <p>We began as the ATA - an advocacy and support network for transgender women in Sydney's Kings Cross in the 1980s. These women faced significant problems with abuse and homelessness and so "Tiresias House" was created in 1983 in Petersham to provide a homeless shelter. This was funded by the Department of Main Roads. </p>
   <p>
    Over the next decade several more houses would be added to this network, in Suburbs like Ashfield and Haberfield. In 1984, a seperate halfway house was created for gaol leavers.
   </p>
   <p>
     During the AIDs crisis throughout the 1980s, this network of residency support houses partnered with NSW health to help promote sexual health and safety in the LGBTQI+ community.
   </p>
   <p>
     In 1991 this network was incorporated into the Gender Centre, also introducing counseling services, advocacy and legal support, and many other services.
